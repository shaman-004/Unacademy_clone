                The sweltering summer of India makes us suffer terribly, especially in June when the sun's heat is at its peak. But you will agree, it is one of the best seasons to plan a long summer vacation, away from the scorching heat of the plains.

              Lipika cried out while giving us the details of her recent trip to Shillong and other cities of Meghalaya. With her eyes shining brightly and a bit watery  with excitement and cheeks getting tomato red, she further pledged that she would indeed go to North East for her honeymoon. Everyone in the room busted out laughing; however, a few days later I pondered over her PLEDGE and decided to do a little research on what are some great honeymoon destinations in North East.
